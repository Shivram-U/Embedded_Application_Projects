DOCUMENTATION:
                            This porject is designed to analyse to Gas Concentration in the Surrounding Atmosphere,
            by  analysing the hazardous Gas Concentration in the Air, using Gas Sensor.


            The Data Analysed by the gas sensor, is retrieved throught a wi-fi board to a Computing Device to analyze 
            the Data and plot a Graph. 

            The Data retrieved from the Gas Sensor is use to plot a Graph, with Concentration of the Hazardous Gas, against the Time.

            Graph Plots:
                            1. Instantaneous Plot - to analyse the Gas Concentration levels at present, over a Range of Values.
                            2. Recorded Plot - to analyze and record the Gas Concentration over a Period of time.
